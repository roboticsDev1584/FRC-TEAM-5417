										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-size:16px;">We recently came back from the Lone Star Central Regional as winners! We had a ton of fun working with other teams and our best friend Team 7179 Crossfire :-). This time our arm worked, and we were able to score on the scale. Along with our amazing alliance partners, 7179 and 5425, we were able to become finalists. In addition to being finalists, we also won the Chairman&#8217;s Award! The Chairman’s Award is one of the biggest honors our team has had, and we have worked towards it every year. With all of our efforts the past four years, we are so thankful that they have culminated into this awesome achievement. We want to thank our mentors and sponsors for helping us soar to new heights.  We had a great experience and are excited to go to the World Championship in Houston! Make sure to cheer us on!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>              I’m very excited to announce the start of our team blog. We’ve been wanting to do this for a while, and now we can make it happen. Here, you will find info about our team, and regular updates on what we’re doing throughout the season.</p>
<p>              Today marks the start of the Dallas regional. We’ve been getting ready for the big competition by making repairs to our hardware, updating our code, and practicing on the field. This is the biggest regional we’ve been to yet, with over 50 teams competing for a bid to championships. Also, members of our team auditioned to sing the National Anthem. We made it! Our group is called Rave And Friends, and we will be singing on Sunday morning. I look forward to sharing that experience with you.</p>
<p>              Even though you may not be here with us, you can still follow the action by viewing the live stream linked below.</p>

<p>We will be posting regular updates here, so keep checking the blog and social media.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
